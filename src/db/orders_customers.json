It also features a 6.1-inch Super Retina OLED display, powered by new A15 Bionic chip with 6GB RAM and offers 256GB storage. The triple cameras have gotten much better thanks to bigger sensors on board. The battery life sees a big improvement as well. However, the model comes without headphone jack, memory card slot and 20W fast charging is not sufficient for the price.
